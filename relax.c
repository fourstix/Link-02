/*
 * relax.c - branch-relaxation (long -> short branch) support for Link/02.
 *
 * Design: a rewrite-and-relink pipeline, not in-place patching. An earlier
 * patch-based approach was replaced after two separate classes of "compute
 * a value early, forget to update it when a later shrink shifts it" bugs.
 *
 *   1. Parse each object file's text into a sequence of segments: raw
 *      passthrough lines (anything outside a proc) and fully-parsed procs
 *      (a byte buffer + an ordered fixup list) for anything inside a
 *      {NAME ... } block.
 *   2. Given a set of "excluded" (must-stay-long) branches, regenerate
 *      every proc's text from scratch: candidate '#' branches not in the
 *      exclusion set are shrunk (opcode -0x90, two operand bytes collapse
 *      to one, marker becomes '<'), and EVERY offset appearing anywhere in
 *      the proc -- byte positions and every fixup's own patch offset and
 *      (for local fixup types) stored target -- is renumbered to reflect
 *      the proc's new, smaller size. This is a static, one-shot text
 *      transform: nothing is computed before the proc's final layout is
 *      known, which is what eliminates the whole "goes stale after a later
 *      shift" bug class.
 *   3. Write the regenerated text to temp files and run it through the
 *      completely unmodified loadFile()/doLink() pipeline, exactly as if
 *      it were the original input. Cross-proc placement and external
 *      symbol resolution never need special-casing, because every proc's
 *      internal layout is already final by the time linking starts.
 *   4. If any shrunk branch comes back "Short branch out of page" (the
 *      pre-existing '<' check in loadFile(), unmodified), that branch is
 *      added to the exclusion set and the whole thing -- regenerate all
 *      files, reset all link state, relink -- runs again. Iterate until a
 *      round produces zero such failures.
 *
 * Only '#' (local, intra-proc) branch candidates are ever shrunk. '!'
 * (external-target long branches, tagged by Asm/02's OT_LBR case the same
 * way) are always left long -- shrinking a branch to an external symbol
 * would need a genuinely different resolution mechanism, since the
 * target's absolute address isn't known until doLink() runs, long after
 * this proc's own layout is fixed. '!' fixups are parsed and renumbered
 * exactly like '?' (plain external W-type reference) and are never
 * eligible for the shrink set.

/* 65536, not a guessed "big enough" constant: the CDP1802 has a 16-bit

 * exceed it -- matches word's own domain exactly. A smaller value is not
 * just a lower ceiling: every write derived from an offset into an
 * oversized proc either silently corrupts heap memory (a delayed,
 * hard-to-trace crash) or overruns the stack-allocated scratch buffers in
 * rlxEmitProc, so this bound is load-bearing, not cosmetic. Real-world
 * single-proc sizes vary a lot by source language and compiler -- a
 * compiler that emits one large proc per translation unit can easily
 * exceed what a hand-written assembly codebase's own procs ever reach,
 * so don't assume a smaller value is "big enough" without checking

/* ---- Library-code relaxation: discovery pass ----
 *
 * -r's regenerate-and-relink pipeline only ever handled OBJECT files --
 * library (.lib) files were always loaded through main.c's own unmodified
 * loadFile()/selective-scan path, so library-sourced branches were never
 * shrink candidates even when object-file code right next to them got
 * shrunk. Since library code is often the bulk of a real program's
 * instruction count, this leaves a lot of -r's benefit unrealized.
 *
 * Fix: before the relaxation round loop starts, run one ordinary,
 * completely unmodified link (rlxRunDiscoveryPass(), below) so the
 * existing loadFile()/doLink()/library-scan machinery determines the real
 * closure of library procs THIS program needs -- exactly what a plain,
 * non-relaxed build would determine. While that pass runs, the two
 * existing "Linking %s from library" print sites in loadFile() (main.c)
 * also call rlxRecordDiscovered() (only when rlxDiscovering is set, so
 * this has zero effect outside a -r build) to capture the (library file,
 * proc name) pair. The resulting rlxDiscovered[] list is then used to
 * build "library pseudo-object files" -- the referenced library files,
 * re-parsed with the same rlxParseFile() used for objects, but filtered
 * at emission time (see rlxEmitFile()'s isLibraryFile mode) to include
 * ONLY discovered procs -- merged into the same files[]/tmpPaths[]/
 * origNames[] arrays object files already use, so the existing round
 * loop, exclusion tracking, and rlxLinkOnce() all apply completely
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Discovery MUST run with rlxActive == 0 (i.e. strictly before
 * runRelaxedLink() sets it to 1): loadFile()'s '<' handler branches on
 * rlxActive to decide whether to expect the extra fields a relaxation-
 * generated '<' line carries (full target, original proc name/offset) --
 * a discovery-pass load is reading ORIGINAL, unregenerated object/library
 * text, exactly what a plain build would see, and a genuine hand-written
 * short branch in that text has none of those extra fields. */
